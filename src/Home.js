            <strong>HARVEST (aka H4RV3ST)</strong> helps maintain the sustainability of
            water sources of the ecosystem. In today`s world we just
            people realized the sources are not limitless and we as a
            people are responsible for any other people and species as well.

            In the beginning, we were thinking about what we could do to save
            the water for tomorrow, we realized saving the water is only possible
            with care before educating the people.

        <div class="block">
            All we have been witnessed lots of harm and irrevocable demolitions
            by some of the well-educated people in history. Before starting to
            educate people there is something we need to do.
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            Now we have learned that care is more important than anything. At
            this point, we have been missioned to explain to the people what is
            the benefit of saving water for tomorrow.
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            We believe we can unite the people, we can explain what is pollution in
            true meaning to protect our planet for future. And all we can work together
            by hand in hand.
