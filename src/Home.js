                    <strong>HARVEST (aka H4RV3ST)</strong> helps maintain the sustainability of
                    water sources of the ecosystem. In today`s world we just
                    people realized the sources are not limitless and we as a
                    people are responsible for any other people and species as well.

                    In the beginning, we were thinking about what we could do to save
                    the water for tomorrow, we realized saving the water is only possible
                    with care before educating the people.

                    All we have been witnessed lots of harm and irrevocable demolitions
                    by some of the well-educated people in history. Before starting to
                    educate people there is something we need to do.

                    Now we have learned that care is more important than anything. At
                    this point, we have been missioned to explain to the people what is
                    the benefit of saving water for tomorrow.

                    We believe we can unite the people, we can explain what is pollution in
                    true meaning to protect our planet for future. And all we can work together
                    by hand in hand.
