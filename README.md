# HARVEST ($HST) ERC20 Token Website

**HARVEST** (aka **H4RV3ST**) helps maintain the sustainability of water sources of the ecosystem. 
In today`s world we just people realized the sources are not limitless and 
we as a people are responsible for any other people and species as well.

In the beginning, we were thinking about what we could do to save the water for tomorrow, 
we realized saving the water is only possible with care before educating the people.

All we have been witnessed lots of harm and irrevocable demolitions by some of the well-educated people in history. 
Before starting to educate people there is something we need to do.

Now we have learned that care is more important than anything. At this point, we have been missioned to explain 
to the people what is the benefit of saving water for tomorrow.

We believe we can unite the people, we can explain what is pollution in true meaning to protect our planet for future. 
And all we can work together by hand in hand.

Follow us, we know the path,

> We are the **H4RV3S73R**.
